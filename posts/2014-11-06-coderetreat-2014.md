[Global Day of Coderetreat 2014] is fast approaching! As I write this there is only a little over a week 
till November 15, 2014 when groups of software developers and programmers around the world will participate
in day-long sessions of *Deliberate Practice* and community known as [Coderetreat].

This year I will be facilitating the session in Austin that [Agile Velocity] is hosting. Come join us, meet
some good people, and improve your craft!

Back in 2016 I wrote about Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in my post ["Why did we do it that way?"](/why-did-we-do-it).  These are lightweight documents stored in a software project codebase along with the code that document point-in-time decisions about the architecture for future reference. Since then I have had projects that used them and others that didn't in lieu of other ways of documenting decisions.

I recently ran across a [great post from Kelvin Meeks on ADRs](https://intltechventures.blogspot.com/2018/06/2018-06-20-wednesday-some-reading-on.html) that lists a lot of great information and resources.  I also like the project he links to as [an example containing a good number of records](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/tree/main/architecture-decision-record) that is still an active project at the time I am writing this.

In fact, since my original post a [Github Organization for ADRs](https://github.com/adr/adr.github.io) has been created that includes articles, resources, guidance, and tooling for using these records.

If you have ever lamented not capturing why a choice was made or want to improve how decisions are documented by having them live right along with the project(s) they describe, see if ADRs might be a good fit for your situation.
